    "We present here the numerical solution for the portfolio optimization problem on social platforms of small number of nodes, for which the matrix-inversion and the vector-matrix multiplication do not pose calculation difficulties, so we use a direct approach to program the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Model}$: We analyze the budget allocation problem where a user has a budget and decides to assign it to users in order to maximize their influence on the network through the participation rate of users in the network through its post rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such a platform, there are $N > 2$ users in total. Each user $n$ is considered as a virtual node and has a Newsfeed and a Wall. Suppose the Newsfeed of size $M > 0$ and the Wall of size $K >0$. Furthermore, each user has a set of leaders, $L^{(n)}$, and she/he can be the leader of others. The Newsfeed of $n$ is refreshed instantaneously by insertion of posts published on the Walls of his Leaders. The user visits his Newsfeed and chooses among the currently available posts to re-post on his own Wall with rate $\\mu^{(n)}\\geq 0$ [posts/unit-time]. Additionally, he produces own posts on his Wall with rate $\\lambda^{(n)}\\geq 0$. These posts are marked on their generation by the user-author index $(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Assumptions}$: The choice of which post to share on one's Wall and which post to evict when a new post arrives is uniformly random, among the present posts on the Wall and the Newsfeed. Also, both post-feed processes per user are assumed Poisson.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a particular user $i$. The steady-state probability to find posts from user $i$ on the Newsfeed and Wall of user $n$ is the tuple $(p_i^{(n)},q_i^{(n)})$. With this, we form the steady state column-vectors\n",

    "These are the steady-state vectors for posts of origin $(i)$ on all the Newsfeeds and Walls of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the influence of user $i$ on user $n$, $q^{(n)}_i$, as the steady-state probability that a post found on the Wall of user $n$ is of label $i$, i.e., has been originally created by user $i$. Note that these probabilities are performance parameters that will be the output of the developed models. We propose the following metric of influence, $\\Psi_i =\\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{n \\not=i} q^{(n)}_i$."

    "Let's select one element in the user set $ i\\in \\mathcal{N}=\\{ 1,...,N \\}$, and let it be the set $ S = \\{i \\}$ (this set represents the set where we want to analyze how a joint advertising campaign of the other users is directed to the user i). In turn, suppose that for each post rate of user $n$ different from user $i$, we have $\\lambda^{(n)}=a_n \\lambda^{(n)}+(1-a_n) \\lambda^{(n)}, a_n \\in [0,1]$, where $a_n$ represents the post rate of user $n$ directed to user $ i $ (that is, directed to advertising) and $1-a_n$ represents the post rate of user $n$ directed to personal use of user $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our problem framework we have a budget that must not be exceeded $P$, this budget represents the budget limit that the advertising campaign directed to the user $ i $ can cost but don't exceed. Also for each user $ n $, there is a $ c_n $ that represents the cost (in the same scale of $P$) of post over time unit of the user $n$ directed to the advertising campaign. Then the user's individualized budget $ n $ is given by $ P_n = c_n a_n \\lambda ^ {(n)}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, note that if we define the influence of the user $ n \\not = i $ directed at advertising towards the set $S $ (denoted by $\\Psi_{n,S} (a_n)$), then the only difference between $\\Psi_{n, S} (a_n) $ and $ \\Psi_n $ is to consider the system as:\n",

    "\n",
    "In this way, sequentially we can add all the users differents from the user $i$ and so we are interested in maximizing over the set $\\{a_n \\}_{n \\not=i}$ the sum of each influence through the user $ n \\not = i $ directed to advertising towards the user $ i $ and the direct influence of the user $ i $, subject to the budget constraint $ P $ not being exceeded by the sum of the individual budgeting of each user $ n \\not = i $, namely: \n",

    "\n",
    "Through our results we saw that $ \\Psi_{n,S} (a_n)=a_n \\Psi_{n}, \\forall n \\in \\mathcal{N}\\setminus \\{i \\}$, in this way, our problem turns out to be the following optimization problem:\n",

    "### Implementation\n",
    "$\\textbf{Notes}$: For the implementation, we first generate an input from graphs of specific form. We choose here to generate a Erdos-Renyi graph, Albert-Barabasi granp, Ring graph and a Grid graph. Furthermore, we allow the choice of self-posting and re-posting rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation will fill in the matrices A,C and the vectors b,d for any user and perform the matrix calculations presented in the paper. The methods to solve can be found as Theorem 3 and Theorem 4. The time of convergence of (M1) and (M2) depends on the number of user as well as the maximum number of iterations and the epsilon in the convergence criterion $||p_{neq}-p_{old}||_{\\infty}<eps$. We set: $it =1000$ and $eps = 0.0001$ by default. Note that the implementation of (M2) is not sparse and the simple version outperforms (M1) in examples where the graph structure is non-symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, we define a cost function in which for each user we estimate the cost per post following the recommendations of the wep-pages https://buffer.com/resources/influencer-marketing-cost, https://buffer.com/library/influencer-marketing-guide and the Instagram money calculator on the web-page https://influencermarketinghub.com/instagram-money-calculator/. That is, the minimum cost that can be paid to an influencer following the recommendations of the Instagram money calculator estimated like the cost per post of user $n$ is $\\$10\\frac{\\text{Number of followers}_n}{1000}+\\$250\\frac{\\text{Average Engagments_n}}{1000}$. The average engagments is equivalent in our model to the average number of sharings of label of the user $n$ in our social platform, which is the average of the set composed by the steady-state probabilities that a post found on the Wall of a user $l \\not=n$ is of label $n$ times the number of followers of user $n$. So, we have that the cost per post is equal to $\\$10\\frac{\\text{Number of followers}_n}{1000}+\\$250\\Psi_n \\frac{\\text{Number of followers}_n}{1000}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we found the OSP portfolio optimization numerical solutions through the well-known simplex algorithm and through the method desired by the user (M1) or (M2)."
